# To-Do-List-w3schools

Hi everyone! As many of you know, I am currently learning JavaScript and one of the resources I used a lot in the beginning was w3schools. I know it's not the most popular resource but it's simple to use. Here is a To Do List I made from there. I made a few changes to the styling from the original. Happy coding everyone!
